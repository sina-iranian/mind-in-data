# 🚗 Regression Workflow — Feature Scaling, Multicollinearity & Practical Implementation

*(Summarized from “When Can You Safely Ignore Multicollinearity”, “Standardization with sklearn”, and “CARS Dataset Implementation”)*

## ⚙️ 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation (CARS Example)

### 🔹 Step 1 — Load & Inspect Data
```python
import numpy as np, pandas as pd, seaborn as sns, matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import statsmodels.api as sm

sns.set()
raw_data = pd.read_csv('Real_life_example.csv')
raw_data.head()
raw_data.describe(include='all')



🔹 Step 2 — Remove Missing & Irrelevant Columns
raw_data = raw_data.drop(['Model'], axis=1)
data_no_missing = raw_data.dropna(axis=0)

🔹 Step 3 — Remove Outliers (Keep 99% Typical Data)

q = data_no_missing['Price'].quantile(0.99)
data_1 = data_no_missing[data_no_missing['Price'] < q]

➡️ Removes extreme 1% of prices to focus on realistic values.

Apply same process for Mileage, EngineV, and Year to filter unrealistic values.

🔹 Step 4 — Reset Index After Filtering
purrified_data = data_4.reset_index(drop=True)


Ensures sequential indexing after filtering.

🔹 Step 5 — Log Transform Skewed Target
purrified_data['log_price'] = np.log(purrified_data['Price'])


✅ Reduces skewness
✅ Stabilizes variance
✅ Improves linear regression fit


🔹 Step 6 — Visualize Feature Relationships
f, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(1, 3, sharey=True, figsize=(15,3))
ax1.scatter(purrified_data['Year'], purrified_data['Price'], color='green')
ax2.scatter(purrified_data['EngineV'], purrified_data['Price'], color='red')
ax3.scatter(purrified_data['Mileage'], purrified_data['Price'], color='purple')
plt.show()


These plots reveal how Price changes with Year, Engine Volume, and Mileage.


Step 7 — Calculate VIF (Check Multicollinearity)
from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor
variables = purrified_data[['Mileage', 'Year', 'EngineV']]
vif = pd.DataFrame()
vif['VIF'] = [variance_inflation_factor(variables.values, i) for i in range(variables.shape[1])]
vif['Features'] = variables.columns
vif


VIF Value	Meaning
1	No correlation
1–5	Moderate correlation (OK)
> 5	High correlation (watch out)
> 10	Serious multicollinearity ⚠️


🧠 2️⃣ Understanding Multicollinearity
🔹 When You Can Ignore Multicollinearity

Not all high-VIF situations are problematic:

Situation	Why You Can Ignore
Control Variables Only	If the correlated variables aren’t part of the research question (e.g., SAT/ACT while studying college type), their high VIF doesn’t matter.
Polynomial / Interaction Terms	Variables like x and x² will always correlate — it’s expected and harmless. You can center them to reduce correlation if desired.
Dummy Variables (Small Category)	If one category in dummy encoding has few observations, VIF may be high but does not affect the model fit significantly.

✅ **If multicollinearity doesn’t distort your variable of interest, it can be safely ignored.**

### 🔹 Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) Refresher

VIF measures how much a predictor’s variance is **inflated** due to correlation with other predictors.

\[
VIF_i = \frac{1}{1 - R_i^2}
\]

- High \( R_i^2 \) → variable is strongly explained by other predictors → **high VIF**  
- Leads to **unstable coefficients** and **unreliable p-values** in regression results.

📘 **Interpretation Guide:**

| VIF Value | Meaning |
|------------|----------|
| 1 | No correlation |
| 1–5 | Moderate correlation (usually acceptable) |
| > 5 | High correlation — potential issue |
| > 10 | Severe multicollinearity — investigate further |

✅ **Goal:** keep VIF values as low as possible so each variable adds unique, non-redundant information.


⚖️ 3️⃣ Standardization with sklearn

Standardization ensures all features are on the same scale (mean = 0, std = 1).
This helps models like regression or SVM treat all variables fairly.

🔹 Implementation
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

scaler.fit(X)            # Learns mean & std of each feature
X_scaled = scaler.transform(X)  # Applies transformation



What happens:

Subtracts the mean of each column.

Divides by its standard deviation.

Returns a dataset where each feature has mean 0 and std 1.

🔹 Steps Recap
Step	Function	Description
1️⃣	scaler.fit(X)	Calculates mean & std
2️⃣	scaler.transform(X)	Scales the data
3️⃣	Output → X_scaled	Standardized version of X

✅ Essential when features have different units (e.g., km, years, liters).
✅ Improves performance of algorithms sensitive to scale (regression, SVM, PCA, etc.).

📊 4️⃣ Putting It All Together
Step	Concept	Purpose
1	Data Cleaning & Outlier Removal	Keep only representative values
2	Log Transformation	Handle skewness & variance issues
3	Feature Visualization	Detect patterns and relationships
4	VIF Check	Identify multicollinearity
5	Standardization	Equalize feature scales
6	Model Training	Apply Linear or Multiple Regression
7	Evaluate (MSE, MAE, R²)	Measure accuracy and fit quality


✅ In Short:

Clean → Scale → Check Multicollinearity → Train → Evaluate → Interpret.
