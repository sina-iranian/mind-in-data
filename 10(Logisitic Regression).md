## 🔹 1. Understanding Logistic Regression
*(from `1(Logistic Regression).docx`)*

- **What it is:**  
  Logistic Regression is similar to Linear Regression, but instead of predicting continuous values, it predicts **probabilities**.

- **Key difference:**  
  - Linear Regression → predicts any number (−∞ to +∞).  
  - Logistic Regression → predicts a probability between **0 and 1**.

- **Why “logistic”?**  
  It uses an **S-shaped (sigmoid)** curve that maps any input to the [0, 1] range.

- **Formula comparison:**



Linear Regression: y = b0 + b1x
Logistic Regression: P = e^(b0 + b1x) / (1 + e^(b0 + b1*x))



- **Logit form (odds-based):**
log( P / (1 - P) ) = b0 + b1*x


This expresses the **log of the odds** as a linear function.

- **Odds examples:**
- Coin toss → 50% / 50% = 1 : 1  
- Rolling a 6 → (1/6) / (5/6) = 1 : 5

- **Conclusion:**  
Logistic Regression is basically **Linear Regression applied to log-odds**, which makes it ideal for binary classification problems.

## 🔹 2. Summary Table Concepts
*(from `2(Logistic Regression Summary Table).docx`)*

- ✅ **MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimation)**  
Finds the parameters that make the observed data most likely.  
The algorithm keeps adjusting until it finds the “best fit.”

- ✅ **Likelihood Function**  
Measures how well the model fits the data.  
- Higher value → Better model.

- ✅ **Log-Likelihood (LL)**  
Uses the log of the likelihood for easier computation.  
- Usually negative.  
- Closer to 0 → Better fit.

- ✅ **LL-Null**  
The log-likelihood of a model with only a constant (no predictors).  
Used as a baseline to compare your real model against.

- ✅ **LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio Test)**  
Compares your fitted model to the null model.  
- **Small p-value (< 0.05)** → Your model is significantly better.

- ✅ **Pseudo R² (McFadden’s R²)**  
Replacement for R² in logistic regression.  
- Good values are between **0.2 – 0.4**.  
- Used only to compare **similar** models.

- 🎯 **In one line:**  
The computer tests many models → picks the best → checks if it’s better than the null → gives you metrics (MLE, LL, LLR p-value, Pseudo R²) to judge model quality.

## 🔹 3. Confusion Matrix & Performance Metrics
*(from `3(Confusion Matrix).docx`)*

A **Confusion Matrix** shows how well your classification model performed by comparing **actual** vs **predicted** values.

|                        | **Predicted: No (0)** | **Predicted: Yes (1)** |
|------------------------:|:--------------------:|:----------------------:|
| **Actual: No (0)**     | True Negative (TN)   | False Positive (FP)    |
| **Actual: Yes (1)**    | False Negative (FN)  | True Positive (TP)     |

### Example:

array([[69., 5.],
[ 4., 90.]])



- **TN = 69** → Correctly predicted “No”  
- **FP = 5**  → Incorrectly predicted “Yes”  
- **FN = 4**  → Missed actual “Yes”  
- **TP = 90** → Correctly predicted “Yes”

### 🔹 Metrics from the Confusion Matrix

- **Accuracy**  


(TP + TN) / Total = (90 + 69) / (69 + 5 + 4 + 90) = 0.946


- **Precision** (How many predicted positives were correct?)  

TP / (TP + FP) = 90 / (90 + 5)

- **Recall / Sensitivity** (How many actual positives were found?)  
TP / (TP + FN) = 90 / (90 + 4)



- **F1 Score**  
Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.  
Balances both metrics — useful for imbalanced data.

---

### 💡 Why it matters:
- Accuracy alone can be misleading.  
- Precision, Recall, and F1 give deeper insight into your model’s strengths and weaknesses.  
- Confusion Matrix helps visualize **where** your model makes mistakes.

---

## ✅ Summary

- Logistic Regression predicts **probabilities** using a **sigmoid** function.  
- Model summary metrics (Log-Likelihood, LLR, McFadden R²) show **how good the model is**.  
- The Confusion Matrix + derived metrics (Precision, Recall, F1) show **how well it performs** on predictions.
