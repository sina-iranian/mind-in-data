## Overfitting, Underfitting & Regularization

### ðŸ”¹ Model Fit Spectrum
| Term | Meaning | Problem |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Underfitting** | Model too simple; misses real patterns | Poor training & test performance |
| **Overfitting** | Model too complex; memorizes noise | High training accuracy, poor generalization |

âœ… **Fixes:**  
- Use **train/test split** (e.g., 80/20).  
- Apply **Regularization** (L1 / L2).  
- Simplify model or collect more data.
